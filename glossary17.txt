object-oriented language:
A language that provides features, such as programmer-defined types and meth-
ods, that facilitate object-oriented programming.
object-oriented programming:
A style of programming in which data and the operations that manipulate it are
organized into classes and methods.
method:
A function that is defined inside a class definition and is invoked on instances of
that class.
subject:
The object a method is invoked on.
positional argument:
An argument that does not include a parameter name, so it is not a keyword
argument.
operator overloading:
Changing the behavior of an operator like + so it works with a programmerdefined
type.
type-based dispatch:
A programming pattern that checks the type of an operand and invokes different
functions for different types.
polymorphic:
Pertaining to a function that can work with more than one type.
information hiding:
The principle that the interface provided by an object should not depend on its
implementation, in particular the representation of its attributes
